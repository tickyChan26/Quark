# Quark
Quark is a Transformer model implemented from scratch in C++, created for natural language processing (NLP) with a focus on Russian. The project does not use large machine learning libraries (like PyTorch or TensorFlow), relying only on minimal dependencies such as OpenBLAS for matrix operations.

(! Training was not carried out due to poor hardware, as a base there is only a file of embeddings. Development is also suspended!)
There may be some flaws and code curvature.

## Main Features
- **Complete Transformer Implementation**: An autoregressive Transformer model including Multi-Head Attention with causal masking, FeedForward, LayerNorm, Positional Encoding, and KV cache for efficient text generation.
- **Built from Scratch in C++**: All components (tensors, gradients, Adam optimizer) are implemented manually without relying on large machine learning frameworks.
- **Russian Language Support**: Integrated with a tokenizer optimized for Russian text, supporting special characters and mixed Russian-English input.
- **Data Storage**: The model is saved in JSON files. Support for other formats (e.g., RocksDB) is planned.


## Architecture
Quark implements an autoregressive Transformer architecture with the following components:
- **Tensor**: A class for tensor operations, supporting matrix computations (via OpenBLAS) and automatic differentiation for gradient-based training.
- **MultiHeadAttention**: Multi-Head Attention mechanism with causal masking and KV cache for efficient generation.
- **FeedForward**: Fully connected layer with GeLU activation.
- **LayerNorm**: Layer normalization with trainable parameters (gamma, beta).
- **PositionalEncoding**: Sinusoidal positional encodings for sequence order.
- **AdamOptimizer**: Adam optimizer with gradient clipping.
- **TransformerModel**: Main class integrating components for training and text generation.
- **TrainingSystem**: System for data loading, training, validation, and early stopping.
